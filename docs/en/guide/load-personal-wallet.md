## Need a Backup?
- You can write down the mnemonic seed and passphrase on paper for storage
- Physical backups are safe from hacking but risk loss or damage
- Instead, copy the wallet file to another location for backup

**Keeping encrypted wallet files is the safest method:**

âœ… **Advantages**:
- Protected by strong encryption
- Easy to copy and backup in digital form
- Less risk of physical damage

With just the wallet file and password, you can always access your wallet. Managing these two things safely is the most important.

**ðŸ’¡ Warning**: Never expose your mnemonic, passphrase, or private key to others. The same applies to wallet files and wallet passwords.
