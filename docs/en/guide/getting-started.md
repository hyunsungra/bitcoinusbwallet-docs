#### Why security warnings appear:
- Programs made by individual developers don't have Microsoft code signing, so warnings are displayed
- This is normal behavior, and files downloaded directly from GitHub are safe
- This is an open-source project where you can check the source code directly

### Program Start Screen
After passing the security warning, Bitcoin USB Wallet's main screen appears:
- **Create Wallet**: Create a new Bitcoin wallet
- **Load Wallet**: Open existing wallet file
